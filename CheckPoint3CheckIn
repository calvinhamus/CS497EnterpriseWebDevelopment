The goals I set ofr this check point were to high.  The charts are functioning to some degree but the saving 
is not fully implemented.  I have been spending a lot of time trying to get a very mobile friendly interface, somewhat successful.
THe benefit towhat I have worked on in this sprint is that it make the next one easier.
